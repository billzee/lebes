# Mobile Flashcards

This is a React Native project for the Udacity's React Native course conclusion.

It is an app that lets you create decks of cards which contains questions and answers, so that you can play a quiz game with these cards.

## Running

Run `yarn` to install dependencies.

Run `yarn start` to start the application on **expo**.

## Extras

I've included some extra functionalities, such as:

- A [Navigation service](/services/NavigationService.js) so that the app can navigate after an action call.
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/).
- [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk/).
- ESLint with standard configuration to lint JavaScript code.
- Prettier to standardize and format code.
- Stylelint to lint the Styled Components.

## Tested platforms

I don't have an iOS device or a Mac system. This application has only been tested on Android platforms.
